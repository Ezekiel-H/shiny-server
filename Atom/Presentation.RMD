## Solving a problem no one saw



Working freelance for Stade Francis I was able to solve a problem they didn't know they had. Delivering quaity analytics that helped drive insight and critical understanding. 

The communication of this insight represented for me a colmination of my ability to assess critically and deliver thoughtful insight.

- Culmination of my experience
- Delivering insight achieving results


## Understanding the problem

### Was there a problem that needed an analytic solution?

- Technical/data literacy
- Reasource restrictions
- Bureaucracy and fear of change


## Examples of challenges faced

```{r, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Assets/abc.jpg")
```


## Examples of challenges faced

```{r, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Assets/3.jpg")
```


## Examples of challenges faced

```{r, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Assets/2.jpg")

## Feedback and self evaluation
### I needed to improve on what I had delivered to meet requirements 

- Comparing Apples and oranges?
- Poor layout and outdated data
- Limited scope for interperatation

## Presentation and value added

## Conclusion
### What did I learn and what did I achieve

- Communicated through a number of analytics actionable insights 
- Allowed a better avenue for non technical audience to engage with data
- Used knowledge of data/development techniques in new data type
- Replicable analysis that can be used to design player KPIs

### Why use render markdown?

```{r, warning=FALSE,echo = TRUE, out.width = "800px", out.height= "200px"}

m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(lng=-0.276, lat=51.152, label="We are here 
             at the Atom Group headquarters")
m  # Print the map


```

##
### Why use render markdown?

```{r, iris, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}


#cols <- c('#f442eb', '#000033')
data(citytemp)
hc1 <- highchart() %>%
  hc_xAxis(categories = citytemp$month) %>%
  hc_add_series(name = "Tokyo", data = citytemp$tokyo) %>%
  hc_add_series(name = "London", data = citytemp$london)
hc1

```
