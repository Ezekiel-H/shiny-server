## Conclusion

##
### Why use render markdown?

```{r, warning=FALSE,echo = TRUE, out.width = "800px", out.height= "150px"}

library(leaflet)

m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(lng=-0.276, lat=51.152, label="We are here 
             at the Atom Group headquarters")
m  # Print the map


```

##
### Why use render markdown?

```{r, iris, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(highcharter)

  m <-highchart() %>%
          hc_xAxis(categories = iris$Species) %>% 
          hc_add_series(name = "Tackles", data = iris$Sepal.Length, type = "column") %>%
          hc_tooltip(sort = TRUE, table = TRUE, valueDecimals = 2, type = "column") %>%
          #hc_colors(cols) %>%
          hc_title(text = "Highcharter Example")
  m
