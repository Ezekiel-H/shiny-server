  This is using data from the [Top 14 Statistiques](http://www.lnr.fr/rugby-top-14/statistiques-rugby-top-14/) site which I scaped by week for the subheading 'Plaquages et ballon joues',      

* Plaquages defensifs reussis 
* Plaquages defensifs reussis 
* Plaquages reussis (%)


I grouped the top 4 La Rochelle, Toulon, Clermont, La Rochelle and took an average for comparison. Its a bit of a quick throw togeather but you can tell me what you are after.
